# Learn Flutter

A project used to learn flutter based on a clone of the Amazon app. This was based on the tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3nmP-lZAdg) and [project](https://github.com/RivaanRanawat/flutter-amazon-clone-tutorial) by Rivaan Ranawat - so massive thanks to him for all the effort!
